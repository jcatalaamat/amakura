# Writing documentation

When writing markdown/docs, JSDoc, or other natural english, we prefer to keep things simple, avoid writing too many lists, avoid bolding things too much, avoid emojis. In general avoid over-use of tables unless it's a pattern found in similar docs elsewhere or truly essential to list out a table-like structure.
