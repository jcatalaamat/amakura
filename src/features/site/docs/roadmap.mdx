description: What we're working on, what's coming next
---

## Now

**Notifications** — push notification infrastructure is built (Expo Push, device
registration, in-app notifications). Finishing up.

**OTA Updates** — hot update system via `@take-out/native-hot-update` is
working, emerging soon with deploy scripts and CI integration.

**SST** — ported from a working production stack, needs end-to-end testing and
cleanup for the starter kit context.

**Uncloud** — improving rolling restarts, internal database lifecycle, zero
restart speed, and overall deploy performance.

## Next

**Responsive refactor** — responsive-first pass across key screens.

**Zero improvements** — error handling, rollback, migrations cleanup.

**Bun prod/dev symmetry** — unify dev and production server behavior.

**Port configuration** — native app port is hardcoded to 8081, needs to be
configurable with fewer touch points.

**OTP flow** — server-side countdown storage, auto-submit on paste.

**CI/CD** — app store build actions for iOS and Android, EAS and self-hosted
options.

**Database backups** — automated backups on releases and before deploys.

**Job system** — async background job runner (currently commented out in SST).

## Later

**Checkout and SaaS** — Stripe integration, subscription management, billing
portal.

**AI integration** — multi-model streaming, bot system (from start.chat).

**Command palette** — HUD / Cmd+K for power-user actions (from start.chat).

**Search** — full-text and vector/semantic search (from start.chat).

**File sharing** — drag-drop uploads, image galleries, video (from start.chat).

**Devtools** — permission testing, data explorer, user simulation (from
start.chat).

## Potential

**Extensibility platform** — webhooks, slash commands, custom apps.

**Desktop app** — Tauri with auto-updates, system tray, deep links.

**Richer permissions** — roles, channel-level access, read-only modes.

**Advanced deploys** — blue-green, canary, Prometheus metrics.

**Onboarding** — custom domain configuration in setup wizard.
