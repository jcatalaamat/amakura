description: What makes Takeout unique
---

Much of the time spent on Takeout, besides our time spent building Tamagui and
One, went into making the details right - extensive scripts, repo-level docs,
well-structured code. Details like building the new Motion animation driver and
then configuring logged-out static pages to hand off seamlessly from CSS
animations to Motion animations took time and aren't reflected in a
feature-list.

Here's a sample of some interesting work done in Takeout:

## Screens <ProBadge />

1. **Feed** - Post feed with real-time sync and optimistic updates.
2. **Detail / Comments** - Comments with native gallery view and aggregate
   triggers for counts.
3. **Profile** - User profiles with avatar upload and post grid.
4. **Settings** - Account settings, blocked users, theme switching.
5. **Onboarding** - Multi-step flow with themed slides and animations.
6. **Minio/S3 Image Uploads** - Local minio for dev, S3/R2 for production.
7. **Terms and Privacy** - Static legal pages.

## [One](https://onestack.dev)

1. **Mixed render modes** - static, server-rendered, or client-only pages from
   the same router, seamlessly route between.
2. **Platform divergence** - `.native.tsx`, `.ios.tsx`, `.android.tsx`,
   `.web.tsx` suffixes let you share routes but completely diverge UI per
   platform. Typed `one/env` with environment/platform constants.
3. **Typed routes** - Auto-generated `createRoute()`, auto-generated
   `routes.d.ts` for full type safety on params and links.
4. **LCP optimization** - `experimental_scriptLoading` defers JS loading for
   optimal Lighthouse scores.
5. **Bundle optimized** - Built-in bundle analysis and agentic harness to
   analyze web performance and lighthouse. Aliases to remove bloat.
6. **Flexible deploy** - Deploy to a Hono server, or switch to Vercel or
   Cloudflare with a single line of config.

## [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev)

1. **Three animation drivers** - CSS animations for static web pages (light,
   fast), Reanimated (native) or Motion (web) spring animation drivers for app
   pages.
2. **Bundle size optimization** - No JS for themes is sent to the client side,
   CSS is pre-generated and inlined.
3. **v5 Config** - Built on the latest version of Tamagui, with great LLM docs
   on all the new features.
4. **Less re-rendering** - v2 Motion and Reanimated animation drivers animate
   internal changes with 0 re-rendering, for much smoother feeling apps.
5. **Best-in-class themes** - No re-render switch on web and native,
   SSR-friendly, unlimited sub-themes.

## [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev)

1. **Simplified with on-zero** - Avoid writing glue code, validators, and having
   logic spread over many files with `on-zero` auto generation.
2. **Server-only permissions** - Easy `serverWhere()` helper makes writing
   permissions often just a line or two of code.
3. **Mutation setup** - Hard-fought setup for mutators that gives you good
   structure, common patterns of usage, and great LLM docs around DOs and
   DON'Ts.
4. **Logging** - Well set up logging, error tracking, and debug modes for
   figuring out what's going on.
5. **Platform storage** - IndexedDB on web, SQLite on native, memory for
   anonymous users.
6. **Streamlined Deploy** <ProBadge /> - Automated restart and migrate progress
   for seamless deploys to production.

## [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com)

1. **Onboarding** <ProBadge /> - Full auth setup with onboarding flow, OTP,
   multi-step profile setup.
2. **Zero Compatible** - Set up to work automatically with our Zero setup.
3. **Phone-first signup** - generates temp email for phone-only users
4. **Public/private profile system** - works well with Zero by splitting public
   and private user information, then gluing together things nicely on the
   frontend.
5. **Invite system** - whitelist + invite codes with use limits and expiration

## [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)

1. **Public/private schema split** - public tables sync via Zero, private stay
   server-only
2. **PostgreSQL triggers** - denormalized counters maintained at database level
3. **Custom migration runner** - creates Zero's three databases automatically
4. **Improved migrations** - A lightweight migration system built on top of
   Drizzle that lets you easily write custom up migrations alongside your
   auto-generated ones with a single command to create or run, and designed to
   build properly for Lambda environments if deploying with SST.

## Uncloud

1. **Any VPS** - Deploy to any server with Docker and SSH access.
2. **Rolling deploys** - new instances spin up before old ones terminate.
3. **Encrypted config sharing** - team can share deployment credentials
   securely.

## AWS <ProBadge /> <WIPBadge />

1. **SST infrastructure** - Full AWS deployment with ECS, Aurora, and S3.
2. **Auto-scaling** - Aurora serverless and ECS auto-scaling for handling load.
3. **Zero replication config** - Aurora with logical replication, WAL retention
   tuned for sync.
4. **Git push deploys** - Push to main triggers deploy with health checks and
   env-specific scripting.
5. **Graviton support** - ARM64 builds for ~40% cost savings.

## CI/CD

1. **Commit-gated native builds** - `native:` prefix in commit triggers
   expensive iOS/Android builds.
2. **Highly parallel** - Under 10 minutes to fully deployed without caching
   including building and uploading images, running integration tests, and
   monitoring health of the final deploy.
3. **Expo fingerprint caching** - JS-only changes skip native rebuild entirely.
4. **Auto OTA deploys** <ProBadge /> - hot updates deploy automatically after CI
   succeeds on main.

## Scripts

1. **Tons of custom scripts** - A ton of Bun scripts from syncing environment,
   monitoring health and deploys, shelling into dev/prod servers/databases,
   easily running CI/CD, and more.
1. **Local overrides** - your `./scripts/` shadows built-in scripts.
1. **Parallel runner** - color-coded output with CPU-aware concurrency.
1. **AI-assisted sync** - `tko sync` to sync with latest Takeout changes, loads
   prompt and spawns claude/cursor/aider.

## Environment

1. **Bun** - Fast installs and CI/CD thanks to `bun` used for installs +
   scripts.
2. **Smart env management** <ProBadge /> - Scripts to automate syncing env vars
   to/from GitHub secrets, pull from SST/production, and thread into every
   service.
