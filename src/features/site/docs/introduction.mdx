description: A complete stack for a modern cross-platform app and website
---

Takeout is a refined stack for building apps that target iOS, Android, and web
at once. No other stack gives the combination of simple code, high quality
results, and incredibly robust setup of all the details from AI Agent
harnessing, to docs, scripts, pre-made interface pieces, and a complete CI/CD
that just works.

Unlike other cross-platform React Native stacks, Takeout lets you build your
entire website easily as well. Easily get 90+ Lighthouse performance scores on
static or server-rendered pages, while still being able to share your entire
stack.

Like the best React Native apps, you can always opt for completely native UI
elements specific to each platform as well with easy divergence per-platform.

> Note: Takeout is in beta! While we've used it in production on multiple apps
> and it generally works well, but it's also a large surface area and a cutting
> edge stack. For example, it relies on [Zero](http://zero.rocicorp.dev) which
> is in alpha. We've found Zero works well and it's in use by many, but please
> evaluate the free version before deciding to commit.

## The Stack

Much of the benefits of Takeout come down to two of our libraries:
[One](https://onestack.dev) and [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev). Takeout puts
them together, alongside the incredible [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev) sync
engine, to make something special.

## Performance

The only stack that lets you easily get 90+ Lighthouse scores on static pages
via:

- a bunch of new [One features](https://onestack.dev/docs/configuration) like
  `experimental_scriptLoading` and `inlineLayoutCSS`.
- aggressively slimming down the initial JS bundle
- replacing `react-native-web` with our own
  [`react-native-web-lite`](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/main/code/packages/react-native-web-lite/README.md)
  which is smaller and can tree shake many unused parts.
- replacing heavy libraries with light ones via
  [Vite's easy aliasing](https://github.com/tamagui/takeout2/blob/main/vite.config.ts).

And it does this while not sacrificing elegant spring-based animations via
[Motion](https://motion.dev) on app-like pages, or other features you'd expect.
