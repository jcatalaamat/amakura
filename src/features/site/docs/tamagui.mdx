[Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) is a style library and UI kit that works across React and React Native.
It provides a typed styling system, an optimizing compiler, and a complete set
of components - all designed to share code between platforms without sacrificing
performance.

## Why Tamagui

Cross-platform styling usually means runtime overhead on web or limited
capabilities on native. Tamagui solves this with a compiler that outputs
optimized, platform-specific code from a single source.

- **Optimizing compiler** - Compiler extracts styles and flattens logical
  components to achieve ideal performance
- **Full React Native API** - Complete compatibility with RN, with zero outside
  dependencies (including even React Native itself)
- **Type-safe tokens** - Colors, spacing, and typography with full IntelliSense
- **Theme system** - CSS variables on web, no re-renders on theme change

## The Compiler

Tamagui's compiler transforms styled components at build time:

**Input:**

```tsx
<Stack bg="$background" p="$4" rounded="$3">
  <Text color="$color">Hello</Text>
</Stack>
```

**Web output:**

```html
<div class="_bg-background _p-4 _rounded-3">
  <span class="_color-text">Hello</span>
</div>
```

The compiler:

- Extracts styles to atomic CSS classes
- Flattens nested styled components
- Eliminates runtime style computation
- Tree-shakes unused styles

## Takeout Integration

Takeout configures Tamagui with:

- **Three animation drivers** - CSS for static pages, [Motion](https://motion.dev) for web dynamic
  pages, reanimated for native dynamic pages
- **Dark and light themes** - With `$theme-dark` and `$theme-light` conditional
  styling
- **Group selectors** - `$group-button-hover` for parent-scoped states
- **Pre-built components** - Buttons, inputs, modals, and more

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { Button, Input, XStack, YStack } from 'tamagui'

function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <YStack gap="$3" p="$4">
      <Input placeholder="Email" />
      <Input placeholder="Password" secureTextEntry />
      <XStack gap="$2">
        <Button flex={1} variant="outlined">
          Cancel
        </Button>
        <Button flex={1} theme="primary">
          Login
        </Button>
      </XStack>
    </YStack>
  )
}
```
