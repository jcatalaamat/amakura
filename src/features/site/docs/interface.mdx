## Dialog

Two-layer system for nested confirmations. Desktop shows a modal with glass
blur, mobile web adapts to a bottom sheet automatically, native web adapts to
the same sheet but integrates with many native libraries for excellent feel.

```ts
import {
  dialogConfirm,
  dialogError,
  showError,
} from '~/interface/dialogs/actions'

const confirmed = await dialogConfirm({
  title: 'Delete post?',
  description: 'This cannot be undone.',
})

// extra confirmation: user must type "Confirm"
await dialogConfirm({ extraConfirmation: true })

// error dialog with smart titles from error codes
showError(new AppError('NOT_AUTHENTICATED', 'Please sign in'))
```

Escape key only closes when you're not typing. Tooltips auto-close when dialogs
open.

## Tooltip

Globally provided with scope to to de-dupe instances for performance, and
provide easier cusomization and avoid conflicts with other components.

```tsx
<Tooltip label="Settings">
  <Button icon={GearIcon} />
</Tooltip>
```

Enables `animatePositionChange` for delightful UI. `closeOpenTooltips()` helper,
automatically integrates with other dialogs, sheets, popovers to close when they
open.

## Sheet

Off thread animations on web, modern scroll locking technique, works with plain
CSS, reanimated, and motion drivers.

Setup on native with `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler`,
`react-native-keyboard-controller`, and `react-native-teleport` for fully
native-feeling Sheets, all without changing a single prop.

## Toast

Native toasts expand on drag — peek state shows title, drag down reveals full
content. Spring animations with reanimated. Auto-hides, pauses while dragging.

```ts
import { showToast } from '~/interface/toast/helpers'

showToast('Saved!', { type: 'success' })
showToast('Something went wrong', {
  type: 'error',
  action: { label: 'Retry', onPress: retry },
  expandedChild: <DetailedError />,
})
```

Glass morphism on native. Swipe-to-dismiss on web.

## Popover

Tracks open state globally by name. Desktop popover, mobile sheet — same API.

```tsx
<PopoverMenu name="post-actions" items={menuItems}>
  <Button icon={<DotsThreeIcon />} />
</PopoverMenu>
```

Smart positioning with `stayInFrame` and `allowFlip`. Escape handling respects
form field focus. Adapt to Sheet easily on mobile when needed without changing
props, just using the `Adapt` component.

## Menu

Declarative menus with sub-menus, icons, themes and excellent keyboard control
on web. Fully native menus on mobile via Zeego.

```tsx
const items = [
  { icon: PencilIcon, label: 'Edit', onPress: edit },
  { icon: TrashIcon, label: 'Delete', onPress: del, theme: 'red' },
]

<Menu items={items} />
```

Auto-closes on selection with a small delay for the animation.

## Button

Glass morphism, haptics, tooltips built in. Sizes from tiny to xl.

```tsx
<Button
  theme="accent"
  glass
  haptic="medium"
  tooltip="Send message"
  icon={<PaperPlaneTiltIcon />}
>
  Send
</Button>
```

## Select

Dropdown on desktop, sheet on mobile. Gradient scroll indicators. Revised for
Tamagui 2 to have much better performance and behavior on all platforms.

```tsx
<Select value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>
  <Select.Item value="a">Option A</Select.Item>
  <Select.Item value="b" icon={<StarIcon />}>
    Option B
  </Select.Item>
</Select>
```

Other highlights: `ListItem` with context menus and edit mode, `GlassView` for
native blur effects, a variety of shape `Shimmer` components, `Image` with lazy
loading and blurhash.
