title: Get Started
description: Clone, install, and run Takeout in minutes
---

## Prerequisites

- **Bun** - [bun.sh](https://bun.sh) (recommend [bunv](https://github.com/ianh/bunv) for version management)
- **Docker** - [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (on macOS, [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev) is faster)
- **Git**

For mobile development:

- **iOS**: macOS with Xcode 26+
- **Android**: Android Studio with JDK 17+

## Choose Your Version

Takeout comes in two versions:

- **Free** - open source at [github.com/tamagui/takeout-free](https://github.com/tamagui/takeout-free)
- **Pro** <ProBadge /> - purchase at [tamagui.dev/takeout](https://tamagui.dev/takeout) for a more robust starting point and chat support

## Installation

Clone your version:

```bash
# free version
git clone https://github.com/tamagui/takeout-free.git
cd takeout-free

# pro version (requires purchase)
git clone https://github.com/tamagui/takeout2.git
cd takeout2
```

Then install and run the setup wizard:

```bash
bun install
bun onboard
```

## Onboarding <ProBadge size="large" />

The `bun onboard` command walks you through project setup. You can re-run it anytime, and it saves progress if you quit early.

When you start, it asks where to begin:

- **full** - complete setup from the beginning
- **prerequisites** - check required tools
- **identity** - customize project name and bundle ID
- **ports** - configure development ports
- **ci-runners** - set up GitHub Actions
- **production** - deploy to a server
- **eject** - switch from monorepo to published packages

### Prerequisites Check

The wizard verifies you have the required tools installed: Bun 1.0+, Node.js 20+, Docker, and Git. It also recommends optional tools like bunv and fnm for version management. Missing something? It shows install links and lets you continue anyway.

### Project Identity

Customize your project's name, URL slug, and mobile bundle identifier. This updates `package.json`, `app.config.ts`, and your environment files. Skip this step to keep the defaults.

### Port Configuration

Takeout uses port 8081 by default (TAMA on a phone keypad). Change it here and the wizard updates every config file in the project. It also checks for port conflicts with PostgreSQL (5432), Zero (4848), and MinIO (9090/9091).

### CI Runners

Choose how to run GitHub Actions builds. The project defaults to ARM64 Docker images, so you need compatible runners:

- **Warp Runners** - fast ARM64, $0.005/min, works out of the box
- **GitHub ARM Runners** - native ARM64, requires Teams/Enterprise plan
- **GitHub x64 Runners** - free tier, but builds x64 images (won't run on ARM servers without emulation)

### Production Deployment

Ready to deploy? The wizard configures either Uncloud (self-hosted) or AWS SST:

**Uncloud** sets up your server architecture, database connection, SSH keys, and optionally custom domains with SSL via Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare. It generates a complete `.env.production` file.

**AWS SST** configures ECS deployment with your preferred architecture (Graviton ARM64 recommended for cost savings).

### Monorepo vs Published Packages

Takeout includes source code for its packages in `./packages`. You can either keep this setup and customize locally, or eject to use published npm packages instead. Ejecting removes the packages directory and switches your imports to `@take-out/*` from npm.

## Development

After onboarding, run in separate terminals:

```bash
bun backend      # docker compose: postgres, zero, minio
bun dev          # web at http://localhost:8081
```

For mobile:

```bash
bun ios          # ios simulator
bun android      # android emulator
```

## Next Steps

- Run `bun tko` to see available commands
- Run `bun tko docs list` for built-in documentation
