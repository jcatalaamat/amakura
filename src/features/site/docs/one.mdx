---

[One](https://onestack.dev) is a cross-platform React framework that runs entirely as a single Vite
plugin. It lets you build web and React Native apps from a single codebase while
easily achieving 90+ Lighthouse performance scores on the web.

## Why One

Most cross-platform solutions sacrifice web performance for native
compatibility. One takes a different approach: it optimizes for both platforms
without compromise.

- **Web-first performance** - SSG, SSR, and SPA modes with aggressive bundle
  optimization
- **True native feel** - Full React Navigation integration for native gestures
  and transitions
- **Single codebase** - Share routes, data, and UI between platforms

## Key Features

### File-system Routing

Routes are defined by your file structure with full TypeScript support:

<RouteTree
  routes={[
    {
      name: 'app/',
      children: [
        { name: 'index.tsx', description: '/' },
        { name: 'about.tsx', description: '/about' },
        {
          name: 'blog/',
          children: [
            { name: '[slug].tsx', description: '/blog/:slug' },
            { name: 'index.tsx', description: '/blog' },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

### Platform Divergence

Use file suffixes to diverge per platform while sharing the same route:

<RouteTree
  routes={[
    {
      name: 'app/',
      children: [
        { name: 'settings.tsx', description: 'shared code' },
        { name: 'settings.native.tsx', description: 'native-only' },
        { name: 'settings.web.tsx', description: 'web-only' },
        { name: 'settings.ios.tsx', description: 'iOS-only' },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

### Render Modes

Choose how each page renders:

- **Static (SSG)** - `+ssg.tsx` suffix for pre-rendered pages
- **Server (SSR)** - Server-rendered on each request
- **Client (SPA)** - Client-only rendering

Mix modes freely within the same app.

### Typed Loaders

Data loading with full type inference:

```tsx
export async function loader({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)
  return { post }
}

export function BlogPost() {
  const { post } = useLoader(loader)
  return <Article post={post} />
}
```

### Native Navigation

Wrap React Navigation for native tab bars, headers, and gestures:

```tsx
import { withLayoutContext } from 'one'
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack'

const { Navigator } = createNativeStackNavigator()
export const Stack = withLayoutContext(Navigator)
```

## Performance

One achieves web performance through:

- **LCP optimization** - Defer JS until after first paint
- **Aggressive code splitting** - Per-route and per-platform bundles
- **Partial hydration** - Only hydrate interactive components

## Getting Started

```bash
npx one
```

Or add to an existing Vite project:

```bash
npm install one
```

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { one } from 'one/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [one()],
}
```
