description: Strip down Takeout for static sites, portfolios, and blogs
---

Takeout is a full-stack cross-platform framework, but it can be stripped down
for lightweight static websites: personal sites, portfolios, blogs, and landing
pages that don't need authentication, databases, or real-time sync.

The result is a fast, statically-generated site that deploys to Vercel (or any
static host) with great Lighthouse scores, while keeping the powerful Tamagui
design system and One's file-system routing.

## When to use this approach

A static Takeout site is best for:

- Personal portfolios and resumes
- Blogs with MDX content
- Marketing and landing pages
- Documentation sites
- Any site without user accounts or dynamic data

If you need authentication, real-time data, or user-generated content, use the
full Takeout stack instead.

## What gets removed

When stripping down for static sites, you remove:

1. **Zero** - Real-time sync, optimistic updates, local-first data
2. **Better Auth** - Authentication, sessions, OAuth providers
3. **Drizzle** - Database ORM and migrations
4. **API routes** - Server endpoints (`+api.ts` files)
5. **SST / Uncloud** - Infrastructure-as-code deployment
6. **Native platforms** - iOS and Android builds (unless needed)
7. **Heavy libraries** - react-native-reanimated, gesture handler, etc.

## What remains

The stripped-down stack keeps:

1. **One** - File-system routing with SSG (`+ssg.tsx`) for static generation
2. **Tamagui** - Design system, theming, and responsive styles
3. **MDX** - Blog and content authoring with `@vxrn/mdx`
4. **Theme switching** - Light/dark/system themes via `@vxrn/color-scheme`
5. **TypeScript** - Full type safety
6. **Vite** - Fast builds with aggressive optimizations

## Vercel deployment

### Configuration

Configure `vite.config.ts` for Vercel:

```ts
import { one } from 'one/vite'
import { tamaguiPlugin } from '@tamagui/vite-plugin'

export default {
  plugins: [
    one({
      web: {
        deploy: 'vercel',
        defaultRenderMode: 'ssg',
      },
    }),
    tamaguiPlugin({
      optimize: true,
      components: ['tamagui'],
      config: './src/tamagui/tamagui.config.ts',
    }),
  ],
}
```

Add `vercel.json` to your project root:

```json
{
  "framework": null,
  "buildCommand": "bun run build",
  "installCommand": "bun install"
}
```

Setting `framework: null` is important - it tells Vercel to use the pre-built
output from One's Build Output API instead of auto-detecting a framework.

### Setting up your Vercel project

**Option 1: Git integration (recommended)**

1. Push your repo to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Import your repository
4. Vercel auto-detects settings from `vercel.json`
5. Click **Deploy**

Once connected, every push to main triggers a production deploy. Pull requests
automatically get preview deployments.

**Option 2: CLI deploy**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Link to a new or existing project
vercel link

# Deploy
vercel deploy --prebuilt

# Deploy to production
vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod
```

### Testing production build locally

You can do a basic sanity check of your production build:

```bash
# Build the static site
bun run build

# Serve the production build locally
bun run serve
```

Note: This runs the Hono server from `dist/`, not the actual Vercel output. It's
useful for catching build errors and checking pages render, but not a perfect
simulation of Vercel.

For true Vercel testing, use a preview deploy:

```bash
vercel deploy --prebuilt
```

Or push to a non-main branch - Git integration automatically creates preview
deployments you can test before merging.

### Custom domain setup

After your first deploy:

1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings > Domains**
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your DNS:
   - **A record**: Point `@` to `76.76.21.21`
   - **CNAME**: Point `www` to `cname.vercel-dns.com`

If your domain is on another Vercel account, you'll need to add a TXT record for
verification. Vercel will show you the exact record to add.

## Route structure

A typical static site has minimal routes:

```
app/
├── _layout.tsx           # Root layout with header/footer
├── (site)/
│   ├── _layout.tsx       # Site wrapper
│   ├── index+ssg.tsx     # Home page (static)
│   └── blog/
│       ├── index+ssg.tsx      # Blog index
│       └── [slug]+ssg.tsx     # Blog posts (dynamic static)
```

Use `+ssg.tsx` suffix for all pages to generate static HTML at build time or
alternatively set your `defaultRenderMode` setting in One to `"ssg"`.

## How to prompt for this

When using Claude Code or similar AI tools to strip down Takeout, use prompts
like this, or even just reference the contents of this page.

> Strip this Takeout repo down to a static website. Remove Zero, Better Auth,
> Drizzle, API routes, and native platforms. Keep One with SSG mode, Tamagui,
> MDX for blog content, and theme switching. Configure for Vercel deployment.

Or more specifically:

> Remove these from the Takeout repo:
>
> - All `@rocicorp/zero` and `on-zero` dependencies and code
> - Better Auth and all auth-related files
> - Drizzle, database schemas, and migrations
> - API routes (app/api/ directory)
> - SST and Uncloud config
> - Native-only dependencies (reanimated, gesture handler, bottom-tabs)
> - iOS and Android directories
>
> Keep Tamagui, One with SSG, MDX, and theme switching. Update vite.config.ts
> for Vercel deploy.

## Key files to modify

When stripping down manually, focus on these files:

1. **package.json** - Remove unused dependencies, update scripts
2. **vite.config.ts** - Set `deploy: 'vercel'` and `defaultRenderMode: 'ssg'`
3. **app/** - Remove auth routes, API routes, and app-specific pages
4. **src/** - Remove Zero queries, auth hooks, and server utilities
5. **tsconfig.json** - Remove paths for deleted packages

## Example: natewienert.com

See
[github.com/natewienert/natewienert](https://github.com/natewienert/natewienert)
for a complete example of a stripped-down Takeout site.

The result is ~33 source files with:

- Home page with projects and timeline
- Blog with MDX posts
- Theme switching (light/dark/system)
- Minimal Tamagui components
- Vercel deployment

Final `package.json` has only 8 main dependencies:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "one": "latest",
    "tamagui": "latest",
    "@tamagui/config": "latest",
    "@tamagui/vite-plugin": "latest",
    "@vxrn/mdx": "latest",
    "@vxrn/color-scheme": "latest",
    "react": "^19.1.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Build and deploy

```bash
# Development server
bun run dev

# Build static site
bun run build

# Test production build locally
bun run serve

# Deploy to Vercel (after vercel link)
vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod
```

The build generates static HTML in `.vercel/output/static` - no serverless
functions needed for pure SSG sites.
